# invoicer

Something I did just so I can quickly issue invoices.

## How to use this shit

1. Open the files in a text editor.
2. Head towards the bottom of the files and look for <code>// start editing here</code>.
3. Change stuff until you see <code>// stop editing here</code>.
4. Save changes.
5. Open the files in a browser.
6. Print the files as PDF.

## Disclamer

The code is what it is. A lot of inline styling, including yyuge libraries that I only use for something stupid. This is just a local file that I run when I need to issue an invoice, so I don't really care.

Don't judge me.
